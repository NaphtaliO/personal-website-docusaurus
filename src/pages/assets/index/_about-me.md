I&nbsp;have built full-stack applications with modern technologies like **JavaScript/TypeScript** (**React.js**/**React Native**) on the front-end and  **ExpressJS**, **Flask** on the back-end. Enabling the creation of some secure **REST** APIs.

In 2024, I&nbsp; would have completed a&nbsp;bachelors in Computer Science at University College Cork.

I spend my free time building projects either personal or with a team on my [Github](https://github.com/NaphtaliO), 
playing sports (basketball and football) at clubs level or playing video games on my PS5.
